<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is a comprehensive game management platform designed to serve as a personalized game library and review system. Users can create accounts, search for games, add them to their libraries, rate and review games, and connect to their Steam accounts to import owned titles. The platform features intelligent search functionality, which automatically imports missing games from the IGDB database when necessary, storing them in a MySQL database for future access.
